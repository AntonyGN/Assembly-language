# Welcome to this repository on Introduction to Assembly Language Programming!
In this repository, you will find resources and examples of the basics in assembly language programming. The primary focus of this repository is to introduce the x86 architecture and write simple programs using assembly language.

To start, I have provided a ```Hello World``` program written in assembly language. This program will display the message "Hello, World!" on the screen. The program has been written for the Linux operating system using the NASM assembler.

To run the program, you will need to have NASM and a Linux operating system installed on your machine or use an [Online Assembly Compiler](http://tpcg.io/_1G96A7).
